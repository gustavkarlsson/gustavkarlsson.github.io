      - title: Skylight - The Aurora App
        link: "https://github.com/gustavkarlsson/skylight-android"
        tagline: |
          The development of this Android app started in 2015 and has been a huge source of learnings for me.
          I use it mostly as a way to learn and try out new ideas.
          It has gone major rewrites, a language change to Kotlin, modularization, migration to RxJava,
          migration to coroutines, migration to Jetpack Compose, and much more.
